```javascript
// LMS implementation is now extremely simple:
const api = new Scorm2004API({
  sequencing: {
    // Provide the activity tree from manifest
    activityTree: {
      id: "course",
      title: "My Course",
      children: [
        { id: "lesson1", title: "Lesson 1", url: "/content/lesson1/" },
        { id: "lesson2", title: "Lesson 2", url: "/content/lesson2/" }
      ]
    },
    
    // Handle the minimal LMS responsibilities
    eventListeners: {
      onActivityDelivery: (activity) => {
        // LMS launches content for this activity
        window.open(activity.url, '_blank');
      },
      onNavigationValidityUpdate: (validity) => {
        // LMS updates navigation UI
        document.getElementById('continue-btn').disabled = !validity.continue;
        document.getElementById('previous-btn').disabled = !validity.previous;
      },
      onRollupComplete: (activity) => {
        // LMS updates progress indicators
        updateProgressBar(activity.completionStatus, activity.progressMeasure);
      }
    },
    
    // Optional: Configure behavior
    autoRollupOnCMIChange: true,
    validateNavigationRequests: true
  }
});

// Content usage remains unchanged - sequencing happens automatically
api.Initialize("");
api.SetValue("cmi.completion_status", "completed"); // Triggers rollup automatically
api.SetValue("adl.nav.request", "continue");
api.Terminate(""); // Processes navigation automatically
```
