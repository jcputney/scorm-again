Type-specific handling: Different data types are handled differently:\n   *    - Arrays: Each array element is processed individually with its index in the path\n   *    - Objects: Recursively processed with updated path\n   *    - Primitives: Set directly using setCMIValue\n   *\n   * 3. Initialization check: Ensures the method is only called before API initialization\n   *\n   * 4. Starting data storage: Stores the original JSON data for potential future use\n   *\n   * The algorithm works by:\n   * - First storing the complete JSON object via setStartingData\n   * - Iterating through each property in the JSON object\n   * - For each property, determining its type and handling it accordingly\n   * - Building the CMI element path as it traverses the structure\n   * - Setting values at the appropriate paths using setCMIValue\n   *\n   * @param {{[key: string]: any}} json - The nested JSON object to load\n   * @param {string} CMIElement - The CMI element to start from (usually empty or \"cmi\")\n   * @param {Function} setCMIValue - Function to set CMI value at a specific path\n   * @param {Function} isNotInitialized - Function to check if API is not initialized\n   * @param {Function} setStartingData - Function to store the original JSON data\n   *\n   * @example\n   * // Example of nested JSON input:\n   * // {\n   * //   \"core\": {\n   * //     \"student_id\": \"12345\",\n   * //     \"student_name\": \"John Doe\"\n   * //   },\n   * //   \"objectives\": [\n   * //     { \"id\": \"obj1\", \"score\": { \"raw\": 80 } },\n   * //     { \"id\": \"obj2\", \"score\": { \"raw\": 90 } }\n   * //   ]\n   * // }\n   */\n  loadFromJSON(\n    json: { [key: string]: any },\n    CMIElement: string = \"\",\n    setCMIValue: (CMIElement: string, value: any) => void,\n    isNotInitialized: () => boolean,\n    setStartingData: (data: StringKeyMap) => void,\n  ): void {\n    if (!isNotInitialized()) {\n      console.error(\"loadFromJSON can only be called before the call to lmsInitialize.\");\n      return;\n    }\n\n    CMIElement = CMIElement !== undefined ?
